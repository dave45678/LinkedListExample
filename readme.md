##Java Linked List Example 
We've seen the ArrayList and we've seen the HashMap. The LinkedList is another collection you might use. Unlike the others, the LinkedList maintains the order of the elements. You can even add an element at a particular position. Or remove one. The most common operations are shown below.

You will also see the StringBuilder used in the code below. If you're working with a String and modifying the string it is more efficient to use a StringBuilder. In Java all Strings are immutable. That means they can't change. THis is fine when you need to create a string and work with it over an over. But if you're making changes to it then use the StringBuilder.

Finally, I show you how to print a list with delimiters of your choosing. This example comes from work I did creating reports that were exported to other formats. I found it really helpful. And it's quite simple! So I wanted to share that with you.
